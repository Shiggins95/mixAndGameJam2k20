### Created in 48 hours but using pre-existing artwork. Sound and code were all created within 48 hours.

#### Known Issues

- Moving turrets close to one another stacks them - should have handled click and drag differently, solution known, but not implemented.
- Scaling issues, the waves become more challenging and at around level 5 / 6 it can be unplayable. Solution could be to add upgrade options in game, or simple scale down the multiplication of enemies.
- Health Bar issue when restarting level. If your turret loses 100% of health and you restart, the healthbar is not visible - I never actually noticed this until after the 48 hour deadline, but solution is now known but not implemented.
- Overall pretty buggy, but still a fun little project for the time that it took and was a great challenge. Also has given inspiration to continue work on this (restart and rewrite properly instead of the spaghetti junction it is currently)
